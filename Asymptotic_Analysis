Asymptotic analysis is a method to describe the limiting behavior and the performance of algorithms when applied to very
large imput datasets.


A Complexity class is a set of problems with related complexity . A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another
problem which is at least as difficult as the original problem. 

P
===
The complexity class of deceision problems that can be solved on a deterministic turing machine in polynomial time(in the worst case) .

NP
===
The complexity class of decision problems that can be solved on a non-deterministic Turing machine(NTM) in polynomial time.


Recursion
----------------

The three laws of recursion are :

1) A recursive algorithm must have a base case .
2) A recursive algorithm must change its state and move toward the base case
3) A recursice algorithm must call itself recursively .
